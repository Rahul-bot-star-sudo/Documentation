Time and Space Complexity give us a high-level understanding of algorithm performance, but they have limitations:

Ignore Constants and Real Execution Time:
Big O notation doesn’t reflect actual time taken (like 1ms or 1s), just the growth rate. So, an O(n) algorithm with large constant factors can still be slower than an O(n²) one for small inputs.

Assume Uniform Operations:
It assumes all operations (e.g., +, -, memory access) take the same time, which isn't always true on real hardware.

Doesn’t Consider Hardware & Environment:
Actual performance also depends on CPU, RAM, cache, compiler optimizations, etc., which time complexity doesn’t cover.

Worst-case Focus May Mislead:
Sometimes, an algorithm with a bad worst-case (e.g., QuickSort) performs better on average than a more stable one (e.g., MergeSort).

Space Complexity Ignores System Features:
It doesn’t account for garbage collection, memory fragmentation, or actual RAM used.
