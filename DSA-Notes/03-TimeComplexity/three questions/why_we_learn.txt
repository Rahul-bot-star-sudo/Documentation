Great question: “Why do we learn Time and Space Complexity?”
Let me explain it like you're in an interview, and then also like a student so it’s super clear.

✅ Interview-style Answer:
We learn Time and Space Complexity to analyze how efficient our code is as the input size grows. It's not enough for a program to work — it also needs to perform well, especially for large datasets.

Understanding these concepts helps us:

Choose the best algorithm for a problem.

Optimize performance and reduce latency.

Write scalable and maintainable software.

Prepare for coding interviews where efficiency matters.

Example:
If you need to search a number in a list of 1 million items, using a binary search (O(log n)) is much faster than linear search (O(n)).

//new

🧠 Why do we need it? (What’s its job?)
✅ To write faster code
It helps us find which algorithm runs quickly when input becomes large.

✅ To save memory
We can choose ways that use less memory — important for mobile apps, games, etc.

✅ To choose the best method
When solving a problem, we may have 2-3 ways — complexity helps us pick the best one.

✅ To prepare for interviews and real jobs
All good companies ask this — because they care about performance.
